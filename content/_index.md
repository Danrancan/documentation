# Overview

The OWASP® (Open Web Application Security Project) CRS (Core Rule Set) is an open source collection of rules that work with ModSecurity® and compatible web application firewalls (WAFs). These rules are designed to provide easy to use, generic attack detection capabilities, with a minimum of false positives (false alerts), to your web application as part of a well balanced defence-in-depth solution.
